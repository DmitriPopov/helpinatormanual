# How to Work With Video

From version 3.11 Helpinator allows you to embed video into topics. You can embed videos from video service providers like YouTube, Vimeo, DailyMotion or from local video files.


To start working with videos select "Video" node in the project tree view.

Helpinator inserts video placeholder in the position of caret. Now on compile time this placeholder will be replaced with your video.

Some formats like PDF or printed output do not support video. You can instruct Helpinator to replace video with a library image or a step-by-step guide via image properties.
