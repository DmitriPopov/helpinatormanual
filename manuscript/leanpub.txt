## LeanPub

[LeanPub](https://www.leanpub.com) is a well-designed and feature-rich platform for publishing ebook and paperback books combined with a digital storefront to sell your books.

It allows to author your books in plain text, using LeanPub-flavored markdown. Helpinator allows to generate markdown source project for your LeanPub book from your project.

You can then upload generated content to DropBox or GitHub and allow LeanPub to consume it.
